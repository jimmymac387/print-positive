          This project was developed as part of an intensive eight-week
          data science fellowship at The Data Incubator. The goal of the
          project was to create an aggregator for positive news.
        </p>
        <h4>Problem Statement/Purpose</h4>
        <p>
          Consuming negative news on a daily basis can have a significant
          impact on our mental health. In response, news organizations are
          starting to recognize the benefits serving positive content to
          users, but they are not the only ones. Other companies like
          Starbucks, Apple, and Coca-Cola know that positive emotions toward
          a brand greatly influence consumer loyalty and can lead to greater
          sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to develop a tool that can be used
          by companies to highlight positive stories to both help improve
          mental health and drive sales. The web application developed for
          this project can also be used to identify the kinds of words used
          in positive stories as well as differences in sentiment offered by
          various news organizations.
        </p>
        <h4>Data/Models Used</h4>
        <p>
          The data used in this project comes from four sources--two neutral
          sources and two sources that specialize in providing positive and
          uplifting news stories.
        </p>
        <p>Neutral Sources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.today.com/">NBC Today</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Positive Sources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.today.com/news/good-news">NBC Today (Good News)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.positive.news">Positive.News</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Headlines are scraped from the front page of each news organization
          using BeautifulSoup and then passed through the Valence Aware
          Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis tool
          available in the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) package to generate
          a normalized score between +1 (positive sentiment) and -1
          (negative sentiment).
        </p>
        <p>
          These scores are used to sort the data and identify the top 10
          positive stories, which are then served to the user in a Flask web
          application. Data for the web application is generated each time
          the page is reloaded to keep the content up-to-date.
        </p>
        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>In addition to providing links to positive news articles, the web
          application also generates a word cloud to visualize words
          associated with positive, neutral, and negative headlines as well
          as a violin plot to visualize differences in sentiment from
          different news sources.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../static/images/positive_words_example.png"
            alt="Positive word cloud" class="wordcloud">
          <figcaption>
            Example of most common words in positive news articles
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="../static/images/violins.png"
            alt="Compare sentiment between news sources" class="compare">
          <figcaption>
            Example of comparison between news sources
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The results show that certain words are correlated with positive
          sentiment. Words like "help", "kids", and "friend" appear more
          frequently in positive articles and may reflect a desire to stay
          connected to family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results also show that the VADER sentiment analysis tool
          distinguishes between positive and negative articles fairly well.
          The median scores for each of the neutral news sources was near 0
          while both positive news sources had a median score above 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          NPR headlines showed the greatest range in sentiment while
          Positive.News demonstrated a much greater skew towards positive
          headlines, even compared to the other positive news source. This is
          not entirely surprising considering Positive.News considers
          themselves "the first media organization in the world that is
          dedicated to quality, independent reporting about what's going
          right."
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the advantages of using VADER for sentiment analysis is
          that it does not require any training data; however, this can also
          be a disadvantage for unique use cases like this project. For
          example, while testing the web application, the VADER sentiment
          analysis tool generated a positive score for a story from NPR
          about <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/08/16/903071127/less-than-a-week-after-starting-classes-unc-chapel-hill-reports-4-covid-19-clust">
          university having to move classes online because several students
          tested positive for the coronavirus</a>. Likewise, a story about
          <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/03/908878610/americans-increasingly-polarized-when-it-comes-to-racial-justice-protests-poll-f">
          Americans becoming increasingly polarized over racial justice</a>
          received the same score as a story about <a href="https://www.today.com/pets/kerith-golden-retriever-offers-comfort-firefighters-t190150">
          therapy dog offering comfort to California firefighters</a>.
          While these kinds of misclassifications were generally rare, a more
          advanced sentiment analysis model specifically trained on news
          headlines may offer classification improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next stage of this project will seek to improve the algorithm
          used to classify news headlines as positive or negative.
