# print-positive
This project was developed as part of an intensive eight-week data science fellowship at The Data Incubator. The goal of the project was to create an aggregator for positive news.

### Problem Statement/Purpose


### Data/Models Used
- BeautifulSoup for web scraping
- Naural Language Toolkit (NLTK) used for sentiment analysis (VADER)
- VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.


### Results
- Static plots (word cloud; compare sentiment between positive news site and neutral)
- Predicted sentiment on NPR returned lots of COVID articles (e.g., people had to leave school because too many COVID cases)
- Base functionality provided by nltk is not sufficient for analyzing sentiment of news articles
